const FAQS = [
  [
    "Is ActivHR free to try?",
    "Yes. Start a free trial for your organization, no credit card required, and upgrade as your team grows.",
  ],
  [
    "Does it work without an internet connection?",
    "Yes. Clock-ins are queued on the device and synced automatically once a connection is available. The timestamp kept is when the person actually clocked in, not when the phone reconnected.",
  ],
  [
    "How is my organization's data kept separate from others?",
    "Every record is scoped to your organization at the database level with row-level security, so no other organization can see or query your data.",
  ],
  [
    "Can I export attendance data to my payroll provider?",
    "Yes. Approved hours export as CSV, or pull them directly via the AttendPAC API.",
  ],
  [
    "What devices can my team use to clock in?",
    "A phone browser or the mobile app, a shared kiosk with QR scan, or the fingerprint and face terminals you already run on site.",
  ],
  [
    "Can staff request shift swaps?",
    "Yes. Staff request a swap from the schedule screen, and their manager approves or denies it before it takes effect.",
  ],
  [
    "Is there a limit on how many sites or staff I can add?",
    "No. AttendPAC scales from a single site to a multi-site organization, with role-based access for every level of your team.",
