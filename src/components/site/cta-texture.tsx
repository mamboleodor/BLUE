/**
 * Drifting grid behind the CTA band, with cells lighting up under the
 * pointer.
 *
 * One palette covers both themes: the band is a dark field either way —
 * ink against paper in light mode, graphite against ink in dark — so
 * light-on-dark strokes are always correct.
 *
 * Kept near-invisible at rest (8% paper). The band's job is to carry a
 * headline and two buttons; this is texture underneath it, and anything
 * more legible starts competing with the type. Masked at the edges so the
 * grid has no visible boundary, and skipped entirely under reduced motion.
